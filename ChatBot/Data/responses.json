    ],
    "passwords": [
      "🔐 Create strong passwords with 12+ characters using uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Each account should have a unique password!",
      "💡 Use password managers like Bitwarden, 1Password, or LastPass to generate and store complex passwords securely. You only need to remember one master password.",
      "🚫 Never use personal information like birthdays, names, or dictionary words. Avoid common patterns like '123456' or 'password123'.",

    "social engineering": [
      "🎭 Be skeptical of unsolicited contact claiming urgency. Scammers create fake emergencies to pressure you into quick decisions.",
      "📞 Verify requests for sensitive information by calling back using official contact numbers. Don't trust caller ID - it can be spoofed.",
