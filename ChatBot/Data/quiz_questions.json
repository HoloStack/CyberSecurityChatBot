        "Use the same password for all accounts",
        "Use common dictionary words"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Strong passwords should be long (12+ characters), unique, and contain a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.",
      "why": "Long, complex passwords are exponentially harder for attackers to crack using brute force methods. Each additional character and character type dramatically increases the time needed to break the password.",

        "Automatic password generation",
        "Encrypted file storage"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "2FA adds an extra security layer by requiring something you know (password) and something you have (phone, token) or something you are (biometric).",
      "why": "Even if your password is compromised, an attacker would still need access to your second factor (like your phone) to gain access to your account, making unauthorized access significantly more difficult.",
