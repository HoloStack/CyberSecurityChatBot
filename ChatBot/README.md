# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot

A sophisticated AI-powered cybersecurity education platform featuring advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities, intelligent task management, and interactive learning modules.

### üîê **Important Note on API Key Configuration**

The chatbot includes ChatGPT integration, which relies on an OpenAI API key.
For security best practices, the API key is stored in a separate configuration file that is **not** tracked by Git.

**To enable ChatGPT functionality:**

1. **Copy the example configuration file:**
   ```bash
   cp config.example.json config.json
   ```

2. **Edit `config.json` and replace the placeholder:**
   ```json
   {
     "OpenAI": {
       "ApiKey": "your-actual-openai-api-key-here"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **The `config.json` file is automatically ignored by Git** (listed in `.gitignore`)

4. **For submission:** Include the API key in a separate secure document, **never commit it to version control**

**Security Features:**
- ‚úÖ API key stored in separate config file
- ‚úÖ Config file ignored by Git (.gitignore)
- ‚úÖ Template file provided for easy setup
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation when API key is missing
- ‚úÖ Activity logging of API key loading status

Without the API key, ChatGPT features will be disabled, but all other chatbot features remain fully functional.

[2024-06-27 15:36:00] Provided tip about: passwords
```

**Expected Behavior:** Comprehensive tracking with intelligent categorization and easy access through multiple interfaces.

### 6. **Interactive Quiz with Intelligent Feedback** üéØ

Advanced quiz system with contextual explanations:

#### **Testing Quiz Intelligence:**
1. Start a quiz using: `"start quiz"` or click **"Start Quiz"**
2. **Deliberately answer questions incorrectly**
3. **Observe the intelligent feedback system:**
   - **Basic Explanation:** What the correct answer is
   - **"Why" Explanation:** Deep reasoning for why the answer is correct
   - **Educational Context:** How this applies to real-world cybersecurity

**Example of Intelligent Feedback:**
```
Question: "What is the most effective way to create a strong password?"
Wrong Answer Selected: "Use your birthday and name"
Response:
‚úÖ Correct Answer: "Use a long, random combination of letters, numbers, and symbols"
üìñ Explanation: "Strong passwords should be long (12+ characters), unique, and contain a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols."
üí° Why this is correct: "Long, complex passwords are exponentially harder for attackers to crack using brute force methods. Each additional character and character type dramatically increases the time needed to break the password."
```

### 7. **Personalized User Experience** üë§

The system adapts responses based on user profiles:

#### **Testing Personalization:**
1. Set up a user profile with favorite subjects
2. Ask questions related to that subject
3. **Expected Behavior:** Personalized greetings and specialized responses based on user preferences

### 8. **Command Flexibility & Understanding** üí¨

The chatbot understands various command phrasings:

#### **Test Command Variations:**
```
Task Commands:
