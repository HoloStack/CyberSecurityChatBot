## üïê **Complex Time Expressions Supported**

### Simple Time Units
- `5 seconds` / `30 seconds` / `1 minute` / `45 minutes`
- `2 hours` / `6 hours` / `1 day` / `3 days`
- `1 week` / `2 weeks` / `1 month`

### Complex Compound Times
- `1 day and 2 hours`
- `2 days and 30 minutes`
- `1 week and 3 days`
- `5 days and 2 hours and 1 second`
- `1 day and 12 hours and 30 minutes`
- `3 weeks and 2 days and 4 hours`

### Written Numbers
- `one hour` / `two days` / `three weeks`
- `five minutes` / `ten seconds` / `fifteen days`
- `twenty minutes` / `thirty seconds`

### Natural Language
- `tomorrow` / `next week` / `tonight`
- `tomorrow morning` / `tomorrow afternoon`
- `next Monday` / `next Friday`

## üß™ **Quick Test Sequence**

### 1. Seconds-based Testing (Immediate Results)
```
# Console Mode:
create a task in 5 seconds to test the system
remind me in 10 seconds to verify notifications
set a task for 15 seconds to check popup display
add task in 20 seconds to validate Windows notifications

# GUI Mode:
Type in chat: "create a task in 30 seconds to test GUI integration"
```

### 2. Minutes-based Testing (Short-term)
```
remind me in 2 minutes to check email security
create a task in 5 minutes to enable 2fa
set reminder in 10 minutes to update passwords
```

### 3. Complex Time Testing
```
remind me in 1 day and 2 hours to secure my network
create a task in 2 days and 30 minutes to backup files
set a task for 1 week and 3 days to review policies
add task in 5 days and 2 hours and 1 second to test complex parsing
```

### 4. Edge Cases Testing
```
# No time specified (should prompt for time):
create a task to enable security features

# No task specified (should prompt for task):
remind me in 30 minutes

# Invalid time format (should handle gracefully):
create a task in xyz minutes to test error handling
```

## üì± **Expected Behavior**

### Successful Task Creation
1. **Immediate Confirmation**: "‚úÖ Perfect! I've created a task..."
2. **Time Display**: Shows exact date and time for reminder
3. **Dual Notifications**: Both popup and Windows notifications
4. **Activity Logging**: Records the task creation event
5. **Persistence**: Task saved and survives app restart

### Windows Integration
1. **Background Service**: Reminder service runs continuously
2. **Popup Notifications**: Custom reminder popup windows
3. **Windows Notifications**: Native OS notification system
4. **Auto-start**: Optional automatic startup with Windows

### Error Handling
- **Invalid Time**: Graceful error with helpful suggestions
- **Missing Task**: Prompts for task description
- **Missing Time**: Prompts for timing information
- **Parse Errors**: Fallback to manual task creation

## üéØ **Testing Checklist**

## üöÄ **Advanced Usage Examples**

### Real-world Cybersecurity Scenarios
```
# Immediate security actions
remind me in 30 seconds to check for suspicious login attempts
create a task in 2 minutes to verify recent file changes

# Regular maintenance
set a task for tomorrow to update all software
remind me in 1 week to change all passwords
create a task in 30 days to review user access permissions

# Incident response
add task in 1 hour to investigate security alert
set reminder in 4 hours to contact security team
create a task in 1 day to document incident findings

# Compliance and auditing
remind me in 1 month to conduct security assessment
create a task in 90 days to review security policies
set a task for next quarter to update emergency procedures
```

### Complex Scheduling
```
# Multi-phase security implementation
remind me in 1 day and 4 hours to begin 2FA rollout phase 1
create a task in 1 week and 2 days to start phase 2 implementation
set reminder in 2 weeks and 3 days and 6 hours to complete final testing

# Coordinated security activities
add task in 2 hours and 30 minutes to prepare for security meeting
remind me in 1 day and 12 hours to send security update to team
create a task in 3 days and 8 hours and 15 minutes to follow up on action items
```

## üí° **Tips for Optimal Usage**

1. **Be Specific**: Include clear action words in task descriptions
2. **Use Standard Time Units**: Stick to seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks
3. **Test Short Times First**: Use seconds/minutes for immediate validation
4. **Check Activity Log**: Verify tasks are being created and logged
5. **Monitor Notifications**: Ensure both popup and Windows alerts work

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues
- **No Notifications**: Check if background service is running
- **Parse Errors**: Try simpler time expressions first
- **Missing Tasks**: Verify task persistence in task list
- **Timing Issues**: Ensure system clock is accurate

### Debug Commands
```
# Check if reminder service is running
show tasks
activity log

# Test basic functionality
create a task in 10 seconds to test basic features
add task test notification without timing
```

This comprehensive natural language processing system makes task creation intuitive and conversational, supporting everything from quick 5-second tests to complex multi-week scheduled reminders with precise timing down to the second level.
