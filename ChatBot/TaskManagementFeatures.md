# Enhanced Task Management Features

## Overview
The CyberSecurity ChatBot now includes comprehensive task management with natural language processing capabilities across both console and GUI modes.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Flexible Time Selection
- **Seconds**: Perfect for testing (e.g., "set a task for 5 seconds to enable 2fa")
- **Minutes**: Short-term reminders (e.g., "remind me in 30 minutes")
- **Hours**: Same-day tasks (e.g., "in 2 hours")
- **Days**: Future planning (e.g., "in 3 days", "tomorrow")
- **Weeks**: Long-term goals (e.g., "next week")
- **Custom**: Any natural language time expression

### 2. Natural Language Task Creation
**Console Mode Examples:**
- `set a task for 5 seconds to enable 2fa`
- `remind me to update passwords in 2 hours`
- `create task backup important files tomorrow`
- `set a reminder for next week to check firewall settings`

**GUI Mode:**
- Enhanced TaskDialog with seconds option for testing
- Dropdown selections for common timeframes
- Custom time input with natural language parsing

### 3. Natural Language Task Completion
**Console Mode Examples:**
- `set the 2fa reminder to done`
- `mark the password task as complete`
- `finished with the backup task`
- `done with enabling two-factor authentication`

**GUI Mode:**
- Activity manager supports completion via natural language
- Task window allows direct completion by keywords
- Integrated with chat interface for voice-like commands

### 4. Enhanced Activity Manager
**Features:**
- Create tasks with flexible timing
- Mark tasks as done using natural language
- Update existing tasks
- View completion statistics
- Search and filter tasks by keywords

## Usage Examples

### Console Mode
```
> set a task for 5 seconds to enable 2fa
✅ Task 'enable 2fa' created with reminder set for Dec 27, 2025 at 6:57 PM!

> set the 2fa reminder to done
✅ Great job! Task 'enable 2fa' has been marked as completed!
```

### GUI Mode
1. **Task Creation:**
   - Click "Add New Task"
   - Select "In seconds (for testing)" option
   - Enter number of seconds (e.g., 30)
   - Fill in task details
   - Click "CREATE TASK"

2. **Task Completion:**
   - Type in chat: "mark the 2fa task as done"
   - Or use the Tasks window to select and complete
   - Or say "set the password reminder to done"

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components Modified:
1. **Program.cs**: Enhanced console mode with natural language parsing
2. **TaskDialog.xaml/.cs**: Added seconds option and improved timing
3. **ChatbotEngine.cs**: Improved task completion detection
4. **ReminderService.cs**: Added seconds parsing for testing
5. **MainWindow.xaml.cs**: Integrated natural language processing
6. **TasksWindow.xaml.cs**: Enhanced task completion methods

### Natural Language Processing:
- Keyword extraction for task identification
- Pattern matching for completion commands
- Flexible time parsing (seconds to weeks)
- Context-aware task matching

## Testing the Features

### Quick Test Sequence:
1. **Console Mode:**
   ```
   set a task for 10 seconds to test the system
   # Wait 10 seconds for reminder popup
   set the test task to done
   ```

2. **GUI Mode:**
   - Create task with 15-second reminder
   - Wait for popup notification
   - Type "mark the test task as complete" in chat
   - Verify completion in task list

### Advanced Testing:
- Try various time expressions: "5 seconds", "2 minutes", "tomorrow morning"
- Test different completion phrases: "finished", "done with", "mark as complete"
- Verify task persistence across app restarts
- Test reminder notifications and completion tracking

## Benefits
- **Intuitive**: Natural language makes task management feel conversational
- **Flexible**: Supports any timeframe from seconds to weeks
- **Comprehensive**: Works in both console and GUI modes
- **Efficient**: Quick task completion without navigating menus
- **Educational**: Reinforces cybersecurity best practices through task management
